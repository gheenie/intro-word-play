# Word play

## Motivation

The objective of this small collection of tasks is to get you familiarised with some of the very powerful command line utilities available to you. This site is a [good source of documentation.](http://oliverelliott.org/article/computing/ref_unix/). Remember to look carefully throughout the first 20 commands to see if any of them will be useful. You should be able to complete all of these tasks with pure command line magic. 
Good luck ðŸ˜„

## Tasks

1. Create a file called `first_10_words.txt` with the first 10 words from the word_list. Research the `head` command for this one.

2. Create a file called `last_10_words.txt` with the last 10 words from my_word_list.

3. Create a file called `word_count.txt` containing a count of all the words in the `word_list`.

4. Create a file called `b--.txt` with all the words starting with the letter b and ending in exactly 2 vowels.

5. Create a file called the `reversed_words.txt`. 

6. Create a file called `3_vowels.txt` featuring all the words in the list that contain exactly 3 vowels.

7. Create a file consisting of all the 2 letters words. Store them in a file called `2_letters_only.txt`

8. Create a file containig a count of all the words starting with p to all the words starting with r - store the count in a file called `p_to_r.txt`. **Add** a word count to the end of the `p_to_r.txt` with a word count for the file.

9. Create a directory called **dictionary**. Change directory into **dictionary** and create 26 text files of the form `letter_a.txt`, `letter_b.txt`, ... `letter_z.txt`, one for every letter of the English alphabet. HINT: There is a quick way of doing this sort of thing. Look into expansions.

10. For each word in the word list channel the words starting with a given letter into each of the 26 word files you've just created. I.e. all the words starting with a into `letter_a.txt` etc.
